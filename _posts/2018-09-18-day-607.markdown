1/ **The Trump administration declassified and ordered the release of former FBI director James Comey's text messages and 20 pages of a surveillance application that targeted Carter Page.** Trump also called for the release of Bruce Ohr's notes related to the Russia investigation. "In addition," the statement reads, "President Donald J. Trump has directed the Department of Justice (including the FBI) to publicly release all text messages relating to the Russia investigation, without redaction, of James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr." The White House called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to immediately declassify and release the materials.

2/ **Trump plans to cap the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. next year at 30,000**, the lowest ceiling since the refugee program was created in 1980. The new low represents a reduction of a third, down 15,000 from the 45,000-person limit Trump set for 2018. The cap does not require the Trump administration to resettle 30,000 refugees; as other administrations have accepted far fewer than the cap permits.

3/ **Trump says he feels "terribly" for Brett Kavanaugh and that he is "not a man who deserves this"** as the Senate prepares to hear testimony from a woman who says Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when the two were teenagers. Trump called Kavanaugh "a great gentleman" and expressed concern for Kavanaugh's wife and daughters, who will hear the allegations against him during a public hearing on Monday. Meanwhile, Trump says he believes the Senate should move forward with Christina Blasey Ford's testimony and allow her to "state her case."

4/ **Trump says he is prepared to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports.** Trump took to Twitter just hours after China responded to the latest escalation of the ongoing trade war by imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods, warning of a "great and fast economic retaliation from the United States." Trump warned that he would be willing to impose tariffs on the remaining $267 billion worth of Chinese goods. Trump repeated his threats from the Oval Office on Tuesday. "We don’t want to do it," Trump said, "but we probably – we'll have no choice."

## Notables.

1. **The Senate passed a short-term spending bill to keep the government open through Dec. 7 and avoid a government shutdown while delaying a fight over Trump's border wall.** The bill was attached to a large budget package that includes full-year 2019 funding for the Pentagon, as well as the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education departments. The House is expected to take up the bill next week.

2. **Mueller's plea deal with Paul Manafort took unusual steps to prevent Trump from pardoning his former campaign chairman.** The deal contains language that would discourage Trump from pardoning Manafort and limit the impact of a pardon if Trump decides to do so anyway.
